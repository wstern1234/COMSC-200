Madam, 

Keep an eye on the radar. If it doesn't look that good for kayak paddling tonight, then the next time which we can rent the kayak is tomorrow noon. 
But at that time you will have to take care of the pup, and only your darling and I can enjoy the trip.

Hi sis,

I only deal with loyal ones. Obviously the pup is much more loyal. You and I really see eye to eye on this issue. Enjoy your kayak paddling.

"Your Madam"
